<p>Application uses sqlite database to store information about all
	files. Access to database is sepatated from presentaion and
	concentrated in php classes which usually require id of record and
	database handler to initialize themselves. Sometimes, when it is
	appropieate, they cache their instances to lower the database
	utilisation. In some cases objects are instantiated rather by database
	result row than id.</p>
<p>Usage of php PDO database access framework provieds enought
	security to protect applictaion against most of common sql injection
	attacks.</p>
<p>Classes are used both to query and manipulate database. But
	sometimes the manipulation is too complex (search) to wrap it to a
	class or too specific (login). This way is the model layer separated
	from the rest of application.</p>
<p>View and control is separated as well. Control is handled by
	process* scripts which always result into a valid refresh and they
	usually set a message(s) which will be shown on a next page. Control
	validates user input. Sepatation of these two layers provides a simple
	mechanism how to disable reprocessing a single request during page
	refresh.
<p>Some pages (and their process pages) have restricted access
	either by login (all except login page) or roles required. Request
	parameters are always validated and tested if user has rights to access
	particulat detail else he is redirected back to master page.</p>
<p>Presentation layer consists of php script combined with html
	fragments which often consists of inline php commands. All php output
	which may contain anything except numbers is escaped. Urls are build
	and escaped and as well. All html fragments are written directly
	without need of any needed php echos. This significantly ease output
	control and validity, pages are valid against HTML5.</p>
<p>
	To improve user experiance, javascript je sometimes used, in fact <a
		href='http://www.jquery.com'>JQuery</a> framework is just linked. It formats
	dates and times to target format (this could serve to localize them,
	not implemented), it maintains a single format which is used while
	table sorting. Javascript date picker is shown during filling search
	criteria. Tags are autocompleted while adding them or searching for
	them.
</p>
<p>
	HTML tables with results are dynamicly sorted at the client side, a <a
		href='http://www.tablesorter.com'>table sorter</a> scripts and css is used.
	Search results were designed to be rendered from JSON gained from ajax
	request to php server, but it would require code duplication (there
	must be search available for users without javascript) and currently
	result data are fetched by an ajax request in formed HTML and
	displayed.
</p>
<p>Filling of database is handled by periodicly launched perl script
	which may be rather hard to get working, it uses some extra CPAN
	packages and some linux utilities which don't have to be available
	everywhere. This script is intended to be a sample backend; there may
	be other backends, the database schema is general enough. Addition of
	new rule criteria or routines would require altering appropriate part
	of php scripts.</p>
